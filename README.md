Our Game

Our game is titled: Johnny's Ice Cream Cart

The game is about creating amazing Ice Cream for the area you are in and then get an educational point of view as to some fun facts of the for that are.
In order to move on to the next area, your player needs to use a combination of Ice Creams to create the Ultimate Ice Cream or ice cream sundae. The only way to move on to the fun facts of your area is to complete the Ultimate Ice Cream in the right order, and earn your score of 300 points

How We Built It

We built our game off of this Month's theme. Accordingly, we used one of the options that was mentioned for an idea: Ice Cream. We know in the summmer time people love ice cream. People like alot of things in the summer such as Ice Cream Carts, Johnny, and Ice Cream (Did I forget to mention Ice Cream?). We decided to make a game. We use CSS to style the background of our game and each page. We then used a black ice cream truck to use as a host for the user. We placed the cart at an adequate spot for each area, so it would look real. After we added a menu addon, where you can place your ice cream flavors on your cone. We added a small spot where you can see your cone and see exactly what it looked like to see if you are on track with the Ultimate Ice Cream.

The Challenges

During the project, we experienced some challenges along the way of complication. We had some trouble when it came to linking pages to the button. Linking pages was most diffcult because when it came down to linking a page to a button, it would give an error message and/or would not respond. Colabration was sort of a challenge as well. Other challenges we ran into was image placement. Basically, some of us didn't know how to center images and or move images into a certain postion.

What we learned

We leared different types of code and classification. For example, how to create seperate classes for a specific variable and how to postion certain images into an area. We even learned some facts about the specific places that we planned to use for our levels.\
